# DischarGen: The Discharge Template Generator

This project provides a platform for medical professionals or health care workers to create and maintain electrical medical records in a more flexible manner.

It renders input forms from templates (discharge summaries, notes, case sheets, etc.) defined in a markup language called **Medical Case Template Markup (MCTM)**.

Templates are stored in this repository as `.mctm` files in the `templates` folder. They can be selected and loaded as per user requirement from the client-side. Templates can be either complete or partial (extending other templates or filling default values).

Read [the spec](/MCTM_SPEC.md) for more details.
